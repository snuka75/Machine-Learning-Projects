NIFTY 50 Stock Market Data - Machine Learning Project
Context:
This project leverages historical stock market data from the NIFTY 50 index, consisting of fifty stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) India. The dataset spans from January 1, 2000, to April 30, 2021, and includes daily price history and trading volumes for each stock. The data is split across multiple CSV files, one for each stock, along with a metadata file providing additional information about the stocks.

Machine Learning Model:
A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was developed to predict stock prices for the Automotives and Finance sectors. The model achieved an accuracy of 95% in predicting the stock movements within these sectors.

Data Overview:
Source: NSE India
Dataset: Price history and trading volumes of fifty NIFTY 50 stocks.
Time Span: January 1, 2000 â€“ April 30, 2021.

Inspiration:
This project serves as a foundation for exploring various machine learning techniques, particularly in the field of stock market predictions. The dataset is ideal for building and testing trading algorithms, as well as learning and applying time series models.
